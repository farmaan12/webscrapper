# webscrapper demo

This is used to scrap reviews from FLIPKART and display the top 10 reviews in  a collection which is then stored in mongodb.

A basic webscrapping demo which you can run on your machine with mongodb connection to store the scrapped data. ( flask_app.py)
A basic webscrapping demo which you can run on cloud like heroku and no database is connected due to no free db services available. (app.py)


There is basic HTML script to display a search bar.


When you run this code there might be an error where it say something may be wrong or Method not found and this is because the div function value may be changed on the website from time to time depending on the website updates. Check the div value in website and update the same on code so that the code cab work absolutely fine.
